# Water-Level-Indicator

This project entails the development of a water level sensor system integrated with a turbidity sensor, utilizing an Arduino board and a breadboard for connectivity. The system is designed to monitor water levels and turbidity in real-time. A buzzer serves as an alarm, activating when the water level falls below a predetermined threshold. Additionally, an LCD display provides visual feedback, presenting the sensor readings to the user. This integrated approach offers a comprehensive solution for monitoring and alerting users to critical changes in water levels and quality.
